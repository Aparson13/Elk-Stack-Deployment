## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85695649/135558755-9a921c73-4965-4ac7-bc65-30062b36de05.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly functional, in addition to restricting traffic to the network.
- What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?
    - Load balancers protect the avalibility of servers. An advantage of having a jumpbox is that it allows another step for authentication for logging in.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the network and system logs.
- What does Filebeat watch for?
  - It monitors log files and location that are specified
- What does Metricbeat record? 
  - Records metric and statics

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| JumpBox  | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web1     | Server   | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web2     | Server   | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| P1VM     | Server   | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the JumpBox machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
  - 199.111.213.242

Machines within the network can only be accessed by JumpBox Machine.
- Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM?
    - JumpBox Machine
-  What was its IP address?
    -  52.170.90.12

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| JumpBox  | Yes                 | 52.170.90.12         |
| Web1     | No                  | 10.0.0.5             |
| Web2     | No                  | 10.0.0.6             |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?
    - Automating configuration saves time when it is necessary to make configurations to multiple machines

The playbook implements the following tasks:

- Install Docker,
- Start Docker container,
- Enter Docker container,
- Create elk playbook,
- Run elk playbook,



The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

 - Web1: 10.0.0.5
 - Web2: 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:

- Filebeats
- Metricbeats


These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

- Filebeat collects log files from machines. An example are ActiveMQ logs and Apache logs . 
- Metric Beats collect how well a system does. Examples are like ActiveMQ metrics and Aerospike metrics

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the filebeat-configuration.yml file to /etc/ansible/roles.
- Update the filebeat-configuration file to include P1VM private IP
- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://52.161.0.230:5601/app/kibana#/home to check that the installation worked as expected.


- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
filebeat-playbook.yml and copy it into the /etc/ansible/roles directory
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_ You use the groups part of the configuration files and put the IPs of the machines you want to use.
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://52.161.0.230:5601/app/kibana#/home

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
